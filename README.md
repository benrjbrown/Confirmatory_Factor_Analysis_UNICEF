# Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis
The following documents the iterations of models I went through as I developed a structural equation model.

The data that I cleaned and modelled for this analysis comes from the Community Child and Youth Well-being Survey conducted my the Region of Waterloo (in Ontario, Canada). These variables were developed with input from youth in the surveyed community in addition to mirroring the framework of UNICEF Canada's measures of wellbeing. As a result, confirmatory factor analysis was used to map these survey questions onto established clinical measures in order to compare the results against the existing literature.
